App Overview:
The Ride Comparison & Booking Platform is a mobile/web application designed to help users compare ride fares from various platforms like Ola, Uber, and Rapido, and book rides directly from the app. It helps users make an informed decision by showing the available options and prices in real time, allowing them to choose the best deal and book a ride without switching between multiple apps.

Key Features:
User Registration:

Users will sign up and log in with basic credentials (email, phone number, etc.).

Authentication via social login (Google, Facebook) can also be implemented for easy access.

Ride Comparison:

Users can enter their pickup and drop-off locations.

The app will fetch ride details (fare, ride type, estimated time) from multiple ride-sharing platforms like Ola, Uber, and Rapido.

Display comparison results for each ride type (e.g., Micro, Mini, XL, etc.) across different services.

Fare Details:

Each ride option will display the fare estimate based on factors like:

Distance and time

Surge pricing (if applicable)

Type of vehicle (e.g., standard, XL, or premium)

It will allow users to see if there are any promotions, discounts, or offers available.

Booking System:

Once the user has chosen the best ride option, they can book the ride directly through the app.

Redirect to the respective ride-sharing platform to complete the booking (via deep links or integrated APIs).

Option to save frequent locations for one-click booking (home, office, etc.).

Payment Gateway:

Integration of a payment gateway for in-app payments.

Users can pay through credit/debit cards, UPI, or wallets (Google Pay, Paytm, etc.).

Secure payment system with encryption and two-factor authentication.

Real-time Tracking:

Users can track their booked ride in real time with updates on ETA, vehicle type, and driver details.

Push notifications for any ride-related updates (e.g., ride arriving, driver en route, ride completed).

Ride History:

Users will have access to a history of their past rides, including the platform used, fare details, and trip duration.

Admin Section (For Future Development):

The app will allow the admin to monitor bookings, fare discrepancies, manage user complaints, and offer promotions or discounts.

Multi-language Support (Optional):

The app can support multiple languages depending on user preferences, expanding the appâ€™s accessibility.

Tech Stack:
